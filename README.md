**WYGIWYH** (_What You Get Is What You Have_) is a powerful, principles-first finance tracker designed for people who prefer a no-budget, straightforward approach to managing their money. With features like multi-currency support, customizable transactions, and a built-in dollar-cost averaging tracker, WYGIWYH helps you take control of your finances with simplicity and flexibility.

# Why WYGIWYH?
Managing money can feel unnecessarily complex, but it doesn’t have to be. WYGIWYH (pronounced "wiggy-wih") is based on a simple principle:

> Use what you earn this month for this month. Any savings are tracked but treated as untouchable for future months.

By sticking to this straightforward approach, you avoid dipping into your savings while still keeping tabs on where your money goes.

While this philosophy is simple, finding tools to make it work wasn’t. I initially used a spreadsheet, which served me well for years—until it became unwieldy as I started managing multiple currencies, accounts, and investments. I tried various financial management apps, but none met my key requirements:

1. **Multi-currency support** to track income and expenses in different currencies.
2. **Not a budgeting app** — as I dislike budgeting constraints.
3. **Web app usability** (ideally with mobile support, though optional).
4. **Automation-ready API** to integrate with other tools and services.
5. **Custom transaction rules** for credit card billing cycles or similar quirks.

Frustrated by the lack of comprehensive options, I set out to build **WYGIWYH** — an opinionated yet powerful tool that I believe will resonate with like-minded users.

# Key Features

**WYGIWYH** offers an array of features designed to simplify and streamline your personal finance tracking:

* **Unified transaction tracking**: Record all your income and expenses, organized in one place.
* **Multiple accounts support**: Keep track of where your money and assets are stored (banks, wallets, investments, etc.).
* **Out-of-the-box multi-currency support**: Dynamically manage transactions and balances in different currencies.
* **Custom currencies**: Create your own currencies for crypto, rewards points, or any other models.
* **Automated adjustments with rules**: Automatically modify transactions using customizable rules.
* **Built-in Dollar-Cost Average (DCA) tracker**: Essential for tracking recurring investments, especially for crypto and stocks.
* **API support for automation**: Seamlessly integrate with existing services to synchronize transactions.

# How To Use

To run this application, you'll need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

From your command line:

```bash
# Create a folder for WYGIWYH (optional)
$ mkdir WYGIWYH

# Go into the folder
$ cd WYGIWYH

$ touch docker-compose.yml
$ nano docker-compose.yml
# Paste the contents of https://github.com/eitchtee/WYGIWYH/blob/main/docker-compose.prod.yml and edit according to your needs

# Fill the .env file with your configurations
$ touch .env
$ nano .env # or any other editor you want to use
# Paste the contents of https://github.com/eitchtee/WYGIWYH/blob/main/.env.example and edit accordingly

# Run the app
$ docker compose up -d

# Create the first admin account
$ docker compose exec -it web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Running locally

If you want to run WYGIWYH locally, on your env file:

1. Remove `URL`
2. Set `HTTPS_ENABLED` to `false`
3. Leave the default `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (localhost 127.0.0.1 [::1])

You can now access localhost:OUTBOUND_PORT

> [!NOTE]
> If you're planning on running this behind Tailscale or other similar service also add your machine given IP to `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`

> [!NOTE]
> If you're going to use another IP that isn't localhost, add it to `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, without `http://`

## Building from source
Features are only added to main when ready, if you want to run the latest version, you must build from source.

All the required Dockerfiles are [here](https://github.com/eitchtee/WYGIWYH/tree/main/docker/prod).

## Unraid

[nwithan8](https://github.com/nwithan8) has kindly provided a Unraid template for WYGIWYH, have a look at the [unraid_templates](https://github.com/nwithan8/unraid_templates) repo.

WYGIWYH and WYGIWYH--Procrastinate should be available on the Unraid Store. You need both for all features.

## Helper actions

### Transfer

A transfer happens when you move a monetary value from one account to another. This will create two transactions, one expense and one income with the values set by the user.

Contrary to other finance trackers, due to our multi-currency support, **WYGIWYH**'s transfer system allows for non-zero transfers.

![img.png](.github/img/readme_transfer.png)

### Balance (Account Reconciliation)

A balance is a easy way of updating your accounts balance. It creates a transaction with the difference between the balance currently in **WYGIWYH** and the new balance informed by you.

This can be useful for savings accounts or other interest accruing investments.![img_2.png](.github/img/readme_balance.png)

## Tools

### Calculator

The calculator is a floating widget that can be toggled by clicking the calculator icon on the navbar or by pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> on any page.

It allows for any math expression supported by [math.js](https://mathjs.org).

![calculator](.github/img/readme_calculator.gif)

### Dollar Cost Average Tracker

The DCA Tracker can be accessed from the navbar's **Tools** menu.

It allows for tracking DCA strategies and getting helpful information and insights.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently DCA exists separately from your main transactions. You will need to add your entries manually.

<img src=".github/img/readme_dca_1.png" width="45%"></img> <img src=".github/img/readme_dca_2.png" width="45%"></img>

### Unit Price Calculator

The Unit Price Calculator can be accessed from the navbar's **Tools** menu.

This is a self-contained tool for comparing and finding the most cost-efficient item quickly and easily.

Input the price and the amount of each item, the cheapeast will be highlighted in green, and the most expensive in red.

You can add additional items by clicking the _Add_ button at the end of the page.

> [!NOTE]
> This doesn't do unit convertion. The amount of all items needs to be on the same the unit for proper functioning.

![img.png](.github/img/readme_unit_price_calculator.png)

### Currency Converter

The Currency Converter is a tool that allows you to quickly convert amounts between different currencies.

> [!NOTE]
> There's no external Exchange Rate fetching. This uses the Exchange Rates configured in the [Management](#configuration-and-management) page for [Exchange Rates](#exchange-rate)

## Automation

### API

WYGIWYH has a comprehensive API, it's documentation can be accessed on `<your-wygiwyh-url>/api/docs/`

> [!NOTE]
> While the API works, there's still much to be added to it to equipare functionality with the main web app.

### Transaction Rules

Transaction Rules are a powerful feature in WYGIWYH that allow for automatic modification of transactions based on specified criteria. This can save time and ensure consistency in your financial tracking.

Key Aspects of Transaction Rules:

* **Conditions**: Set specific criteria that a transaction must meet for the rule to apply. This can include attributes like description, amount, account, etc.
* **Actions**: Define what changes should be made to a transaction when the conditions are met. This can include setting categories, tags, or modifying other fields.
* **Activation Options**: Rules can be set to apply when transactions are created, updated, or both.

#### Actions and Conditions

When creating a new rule, you will need to add a Condition and, later, Actions.

Both use a limited subset of Python, via [SimpleEval](https://github.com/danthedeckie/simpleeval).

The Condition must evaluate to True or False, and the Action must evaluate to a value that will be set on the selected field.

You may use any of the available [variables](#available-variables) and [functions](#available-functions).

#### Available variables

* `account_name`
* `account_id`
* `account_group_name`
* `account_group_id`
* `is_asset_account`
* `is_archived_account`
* `category_name`
* `category_id`
* `tag_names`
* `tag_ids`
* `entities_names`
* `entities_ids`
* `is_expense`
* `is_income`
* `is_paid`
* `description`
* `amount`
* `notes`
* `date`
* `reference_date`

#### Available functions

* `relativedelta`

#### Examples

Add a tag to an income transaction if it happens in a specific account

```
If...
account_name == "My Investing Account" and is_income

Then...
Set Tags to
tag_names + ["Yield"]
```

---

Move credit card transactions to next month when they happen at a cutoff date

```
If...
account_name == "My credit card" and date.day >= 26 and reference_date.month == date.month

Then...
Set Reference Date to
reference_date + relativedelta(months=1)).replace(day=1)
```
# Caveats and Warnings

- I'm not an accountant, some terms and even calculations might be wrong. Make sure to open an issue if you see anything that could be improved.
- Pretty much all calculations are done at run time, this can lead to some performance degradation. On my personal instance, I have 3000+ transactions over 4+ years and 4000+ exchange rates, and load times average at around 500ms for each page, not bad overall.
- This isn't a budgeting or double-entry-accounting application, if you need those features there's a lot of options out there, if you really need them in WYGIWYH, open a discussion.
